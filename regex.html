      <h1 id="what-and-why-is-rin">What and why is RIN?</h1>
<p>RIN stands for Regulation Identifier Numbers which is placed in rules’ content. It is a similar to <a href="./rules-article.html#what-is-file-number">file number</a>.<br />
You might want to ask why RIN needed to be extracted despite the existence of file number. With that being said, the reason why RIN is extracted is some rules are re-proposed.<br />
When a rule is re-proposed, it doesn’t always have the same rule ID, rule name, rule content, and file number. Sometimes, the original rule and re-proposed rule are almost the same. However, it’s also true that re-proposed rule and original rule can be different in few ways.<br />
Thus, as a consistent metric to keep track of the rule-making process, RIN was extracted and collected since RIN is robust to re-proposal without changing.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The SEC has renewed their website, and fortunately RINs are posted along with rules. The code here won’t be used in the future and archived.</p>

<h1 id="files">Files</h1>

<h2 id="each-rules-rin">Each rule’s RIN</h2>

<p>Spreadsheet has two columns(three columns if you downloaded spreadsheet with text). One is RIN and the other is rule ID corresponding to the RIN.<br />
If a cell of RIN column is empty, it means the rule has no RIN.<br />
In this case, non-RIN rule was ruled out during matching with final rule.</p>

<p>If you get confused what inner is and outer is, inner contains only matched rules(intersection) and outer contains rules that don’t have any matching(union).</p>

<h1 id="code-used">Code used</h1>
<p>Unlike file number which was able to be retrieved through scrapper, RIN is embedded in rule contents(text). Thus, regular expression was used to extract it.<br />
To ensure integrity of RIN found through Reg Ex, extracted RINs were audited both manually(used SQL) and in multidirectional ways.</p>
