<h1 id="what-is-this-project">What is this project?</h1>

<p>The project kickstarted at January, 2023 in University of California Berkeley, advised by professor <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/frank-partnoy/#tab_profile">Frank Partnoy</a>, <a href="https://law.duke.edu/fac/bishop/">Robert Bishop</a>, and Ilya Akdemir.<br />
Despite numerous documents data created by the SEC, to date, there has been no academic research on the SECâ€™s rulemaking process. This is because the number of the rules and comments are huge ,so  it is labor-intensive to read and analyze all of the documents. Thus, here, this project employs some NLP techniques to proceed all data.
A plethora of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/rulemaking-activity">SEC proposed rules and final rules</a>, and comments were analyzed during the project.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-sec">What is the SEC?</h1>

<p>The SEC(Securities and Exchange Commission) is a federal agency which enforces the law against market manipulation.<br />
When the SEC embarks on its rulemaking duties, it publishes a concept release to the federal register. The public will then submit comments on the proposed rule which are reviewed by the SEC.<br />
Commenters range from big banks like Goldman Sachs to individual investors. Certain rules are finalized while others are not, and some rules are similar to original proposal while others change significantly.</p>
