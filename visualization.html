<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-proposed-rule-to-be-finalized">How long does it take to proposed rule to be finalized</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/visualization/approval_period.png" alt="comment_complex" /></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="complexity-between-finalized-rule-and-not-finalized-rule">Complexity between finalized rule and not finalized rule</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/visualization/comment_complexity.png" alt="comment_complex" /><br />
The complexity is calculated by grade scale(from 1st grade to Nth grade) of Flesch Reading Ease score, The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning fog index, SMOG, Automated readability index, The Coleman-Liau Index, Linsear Write Formula, and Dale–Chall readability formula.<br />
One grade scale of each metric is aggregated. The mode value(most frequent value) was chosen to represent comments complexity of each proposed rule.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="number-of-comments-across-years">Number of comments across years</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/visualization/num of comments.png" alt="num_complex" /><br />
You may notice the number of comments skyrocketed at the onset of recession period(2008).</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="complexity-of-comments-across-years">Complexity of comments across years</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/visualization/year_complexity.png" alt="complex_years" /><br />
Unlike the plot above, it shows spike at the onset of early 2000s recession.<br />
It may imply that account rule could be complex than back rule.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="cosine-similarity-between-proposed-and-final-rule">Cosine Similarity between proposed and final rule</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/visualization/year_cosim.png" alt="comment_complex" />
This result is interesting because it proves Jay Clayton(SEC Chairman form 2017 until 2020) preserved the contents of proposed rules without big reformation.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="number-of-words-in-proposed-rule-across-years">Number of words in proposed rule across years</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/visualization/rule_number.png" alt="comment_complex" /><br />
Just like the plot above, this is also interesting.<br />
The spike at 2022 shows the SEC published extraordinary great amount of rules or contetns from Gary Gensler tenure(SEC Chairman form 2021).</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="comments-to-rules-correlation">Comments to rules correlation</h2>

<h3 id="comments-number-and-cosine-simiarity">Comments number and cosine simiarity</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/visualization/complexity-commenet number.png" alt="comment_complex" /><br />
The plot shows that the number of comments doesn’t affect simiarity between proposed and final rule.<br />
Also, according to pearson correlation coefficient, the correlation coefficient is just -0.07 which is not significant at all.</p>

<h3 id="comments-complexity-and-cosine-simiarity">Comments complexity and cosine simiarity</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/visualization/complexity-commenet number.png" alt="comment_complex" /><br />
Again, the plot also shows that comments complexity doesn’t affect simiarity between proposed and final rule.<br />
Also, according to pearson correlation coefficient, the correlation coefficient is just 0.16. It still not enough to prove meaningful correlation.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="is-comments-complexity-and-the-number-of-comments-related">Is comments complexity and the number of comments related?</h2>
<p>This question might be helpful to understand analysis above because we all tend to mislead ourselve into something complicated is equals somethings a lot. However, Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist, once said it’s not complicated, it’s many.<br />
His quote describe which point we are baffled at. The massive amount of comments doesn’t mean that comments are complex to read. The below plot shows evidence.<br />
<img src="/assets/visualization/Comment_num - complexity.png" alt="comment_complex" /><br />
As you can see here, those two variable(complexity and the number of comments) are not correlated(pearson correlation coefficient: -0.16).</p>
